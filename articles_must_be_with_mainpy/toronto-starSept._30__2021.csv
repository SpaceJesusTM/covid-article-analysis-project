COVID-19 vaccines highly effective over time, according to new Quebec study | The Star
['MONTREAL - COVID-19 vaccines are more than 97-per-cent effective against death and more than 92-per-cent effective against hospitalisation, even in the presence of the Delta variant, according to a new study by Quebec’s public health research institute (INSPQ), published on Wednesday. In addition, the high level of protection lasts a long time.', 'Of the 181 people who died due to COVID-19 between March 14 and Sept. 11, 2021, only three had been vaccinated with two doses, giving a vaccine efficacy against death of more than 97 per cent.', '“It’s very good. The data are very comparable to clinical studies from different manufacturers and data that are published in different countries all over the world,” said Alain Lamarre, professor-researcher specializing in immunology and virology at the province’s leading research institute (INRS).', 'The results show a vaccine efficacy of more than 92 per cent against hospitalisations, regardless of the vaccine used. The efficacy is high for all strains of the virus, including the Delta variant.', '“It shows excellent protection against hospitalisations (in the presence of the) Delta variant. The results are as high as we expected,“ said Gaston De Serres, epidemiologist at INSPQ and member of the Quebec immunization committee (CIQ).', '***', 'Vaccine efficacy against mild infections is lower for people who got AstraZeneca’s vaccine. In fact, protection against all infections is 90 per cent for people who got an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) for at least one of their two doses. However, the efficacy drops to 82 per cent for people who received two doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.', 'For the Delta variant, vaccine efficacy drops to 80 per cent in individuals with at least one out of two doses being an mRNA vaccine and to 66 per cent in those vaccinated with two doses of AstraZeneca.', '“When it comes to hospitalisations, AstraZeneca is performing very well. It is only for less severe infections that it is a little lower,” De Serres said.', 'The CIQ has been informed of the study’s results, and is considering offering an mRNA third dose to people who got two doses of AstraZeneca. “Discussions have just started. We haven’t reached a conclusion yet,” De Serres said.', '***', 'According to the new study, vaccine efficacy against infections increases when the interval between doses is longer and appears to peak after seven weeks. “The government’s strategy to increase the time between the two doses was therefore a good idea,” Lamarre said.', 'Quebec’s vaccination strategy hoped to protect those at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying, as well as protecting health-care workers in contact with vulnerable patients.', 'The decision appears to put Quebec in a better position than other countries, such as the United States or Israel, which followed the vaccine interval recommended by manufacturers. Israel is experiencing an increase in cases and is administering a third dose to its population, and a fourth wave is hitting our southern neighbours hard.', '“Most Quebecers received their two doses with an interval longer than seven weeks. It looks like we’re going to get more protection,” De Serres said.', 'Pfizer-BioNTech recommended an interval of three weeks, and Moderna recommended four weeks between doses.', 'A longer delay was especially beneficial for people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine. With a three-week delay between the two doses, AstraZeneca’s vaccine efficacy for all infections was 47 per cent. This increased to 92 per cent with a delay of 16 weeks.', '“This increase in efficiency is not insignificant. In addition, this strategy made it possible to vaccinate more people with one dose from the start,” Lamarre said.', '***', 'The study also found that vaccine efficacy remains stable for months after the second dose.', '“These data show that the general population does not need a third dose at this time, but the situation must still be monitored. The effectiveness will definitely go down, since there is always a decrease in the immune response over time,” Lamarre said.', 'However, these data do not include people who live in retirement homes and long-term care homes (CHSLDs). “These people are often older and more vulnerable, so we recommend for them to have a third dose,” De Serres said.', 'To date, 6.7 million Quebecers received at least a first dose of vaccine, or 77.9 per cent of the population. Of that number, 6.3 million, or 73.4 per cent of the population, are double-vaccinated.', '***', 'The downward trend in COVID-19 cases in the province continued Wednesday, dropping by 11 per cent over one week. Quebec reported 594 new cases, bringing the seven-day daily average to 650.', 'The most recent data show seven new deaths, keeping the seven-day daily average of deaths at four. Since the start of the pandemic, 11,369 Quebecers have died because of COVID-19.', 'The number of hospitalisations has decreased: 306 people are currently hospitalised, a decrease of 15 from the day before. There are 91 people in intensive care, compared to 94 a day earlier.', '– In collaboration with Pierre-André Normandin, La Presse']
