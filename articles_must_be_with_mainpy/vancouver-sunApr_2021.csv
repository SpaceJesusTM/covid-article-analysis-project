Poll: Most unvaccinated Canadians uncomfortable with AstraZeneca shot | Vancouver Sun
['The majority of unvaccinated Canadians say they are uncomfortable with the idea of receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, according to a online survey from Angus Reid.', 'Canadian provinces, acting on a recommendation from Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in people under age 55 last month after new data from Europe suggested the risk of blood clots is now potentially as high as one in 100,000 compared to the one in one million risk previously believed.', 'The news has had a significant impact on the public’s confidence in the vaccine with just 41 per cent of poll respondents saying they would be comfortable receiving the AstraZeneca jab.', 'Of the 54 per cent who responded they would be uncomfortable receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, 23 per cent said they would reject the brand outright.', 'There has been no reports of blood clot incidents in people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in Canada and health authorities maintain the vaccine is safe and effective.', 'Poll respondents did not have the same concerns with the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.', 'Pfizer scored 92 per cent on the comfort scale while Moderna was just two points behind at 90 per cent. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine, which has been approved in Canada but isn’t expect to arrive here until the end of April, was viewed favourably by 70 per cent of respondents.', 'The online survey of 1,577 Canadian adults was conducted from April 5-6. It carries a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.']
