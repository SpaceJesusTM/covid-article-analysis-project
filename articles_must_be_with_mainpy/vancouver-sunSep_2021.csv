Mixing COVID vaccines offer high level of protection: BCCDC data | Vancouver Sun
['The mix-and-match approach B.C. used to administer COVID-19 vaccines to some people appears to give high levels of immunity against the novel coronavirus, a B.C. study has found.', 'The B.C. Centre for Disease Control study looked at the levels of protection offered by either two doses of an mRNA vaccine, two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, or a combination of the two types.', 'It found that all the combinations reduced hospitalization risk from COVID-19 by more than 90 per cent.', 'Protection was highest among people who received either two doses of an mRNA vaccine — Pfizer or Moderna — or a mixed AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccine.', 'Infection risk among those who received mRNA shots and those who received a mixed dose was reduced by 91 to 92 per cent, said the study.', 'Hospitalization risk was reduced by 99 per cent for those who received a mixed dose, one point higher than those who received solely mRNA vaccines.', 'People who received only AstraZeneca had their infection risk reduced by 72 per cent and hospitalization risk by 93 per cent.', 'The study, conducted from May 30 to Sept. 11 among a sample size of 246,656 people age 18 and older, also found that the vaccines are highly effective against the more transmissible Delta variant.', 'The vaccines remain strong until at least four months after the second mRNA dose, said the study. At about 16 weeks, protection against infection dips to above 80 per cent, while protection against hospitalization is around 95 per cent.']
