Anti-vaccine activists peddle theories that Covid-19 shots are deadly, undermining vaccination - CNN
['Anti-vaccine groups are exploiting the suffering and death of people who happen to fall ill after receiving a covid shot, threatening to undermine the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history.', 'In some cases, anti-vaccine activists are ', '"This is exactly what anti-vaccine groups do," said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious diseases specialist and author of "Preventing the Next Pandemic: Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti-Science."', 'Anti-vaccine groups have falsely claimed for decades that ', ', weaving fantastic conspiracy theories involving government, Big Business and the media.', 'Now, the same groups are blaming patients\' coincidental medical problems on covid shots, even when it\'s clear that age or underlying health conditions are to blame, Hotez said. "They will sensationalize anything that happens after someone gets a vaccine and attribute it to the vaccine," Hotez said.', 'As more seniors receive their first covid shots, many will inevitably suffer from unrelated heart attacks, strokes and other serious medical problems — not because of the vaccine but, rather, their ', ", said epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.", 'For example, in a group of 10 million people, nearly 800 people ages 55 to 64 typically die of heart attacks or coronary disease in one week, Osterholm said. Public health officials "are not ready" for the onslaught of news and social media stories to come, he cautioned.', '"The media will write a story that John Doe got his vaccine at 8 a.m. and at 4 p.m. he had a heart attack," Osterholm said on his ', '. "They will make assumptions that it\'s cause and effect."', "Public health officials need to do a better job communicating the risks — real and imagined — from vaccines, said Osterholm, who served on President Joe Biden's transition coronavirus advisory board.", '"You get one chance to make a first impression," Osterholm said. "Even if we come back later and say, "No, [the deaths] had nothing to do with vaccination, it was coronary artery disease,\' the damage has already been done."', 'Anti-vaccine groups such as the ', ' and ', ', founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are already inflaming fears about a ', ' — mostly in Europe — that have followed the worldwide rollout of immunizations.', 'In a ', ', Kennedy scoffed at ', " that concluded a Portuguese woman's death was unrelated to a vaccine. He cast doubt on statements by ", ' who said the deaths of two people there after vaccination were due to old age and chronic lung disease. In an interview, Kennedy said the post-vaccination deaths of some ', ' are a danger sign. Norwegian officials have said the elderly patients died of their underlying illnesses, not from the vaccine.', '"Coincidence is turning out to be quite lethal to COVID vaccine recipients," Kennedy wrote. Kennedy described the deaths as suspicious, accusing medical officials of following an "all-too-familiar vaccine propaganda playbook" and "strategic chicanery."', 'Here in the U.S., vaccine opponents have pounced on the tragedy of ', ', a 56-year-old Florida obstetrician-gynecologist, to sow doubts about vaccine safety and government oversight.

Following an investigation, vaccinations resumed a few days later.', '"We\'re going to see these events happen, and we have to follow up on every one of these cases," Osterholm said. "I don\'t want people to think that we\'re sweeping them under the rug."', 'Many Americans were already nervous about covid vaccines, with 27% saying they "probably or definitely" would not get a shot, even if the shots were free and deemed safe by scientists, according to a ', '.

', "Seven experts in blood disorders interviewed by KHN said there's not enough information available to blame Michael's decline on a vaccine and that the demonstrated benefits of covid vaccinations vastly outweigh any potential risk of bleeding. Even if investigators conclude that Michael's vaccine caused his death, it would still be an incredibly rare event, given that more than ", '.', '"It shouldn\'t give anyone pause about whether the vaccine is safe or not," said Dr. James Zehnder, a hematologist and director of clinical pathology at Stanford Medicine.', "Michael's bleeding disorder could have been developing silently for some time, said Dr. Adam Cuker, director of the Penn Blood Disorders Center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. It could be a coincidence that Michael started showing symptoms shortly after vaccination, he said. About 30 Americans are diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia every day.", "The timing of Michael's illness suggests it had another cause, doctors said. According to his wife's Facebook post, his bleeding problems began three days after his first covid shot. It takes the body 10 to 14 days after vaccination to generate antibodies, which would be needed to cause immune thrombocytopenia, said Dr. Cindy Neunert, a pediatric hematologist at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.", "In most cases, the cause of thrombocytopenia is never known, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.", 'Immune thrombocytopenia is linked, rarely, to ', ', with about ', '.', 'But it can also be caused by viruses themselves, including measles and the ', ", said Dr. Sven Olson, an assistant professor of hematology-medical oncology at Oregon Health & Science University's school of medicine. ", 'Many patients with immune thrombocytopenia are now wondering if they should be vaccinated against covid, Cuker said. Cuker said he urges nervous patients to be vaccinated, noting that any problems could be managed by closely monitoring their platelet levels and adjusting medication if needed.', 'Even in patients with underlying bleeding conditions, "it\'s still safer to get vaccinated than to get covid," Zehnder said.', '"If you give a vaccine to a large enough number of people, there are going to be rare adverse events but there are also going to be coincidental events unrelated to the vaccine," Cuker said. "If an anti-vaccine group uses a single case, where no link has been proven, to discourage people from vaccination, that\'s terrible."', 'Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, said her site provides balanced information from reputable news sources, including CNN, CBS and the Miami Herald, as well as Pfizer and the CDC.', 'In an interview with KHN, Kennedy said he questions why government officials have been so quick to dismiss connections between vaccinations and deaths. "How in the world do they know if it\'s a vaccine injury or not?" he asked.', '"We don\'t discourage anybody from getting vaccinated," Kennedy said. "All we\'re doing is conveying the data, which is what the government should be doing. ...
