What does Omicron mean for Canada's vaccinated majority? | Vancouver Sun
['News of the Omicron variant has many Canadians dreading yet another lockdown, two years into the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Authorities remain on high alert in Canada since confirming at least seven cases of the variant as of Tuesday, but early data out of South Africa, which first reported the variant’s development, suggest that it has mostly targeted the unvaccinated.', 'So what does the Omicron variant mean for a Canadian population whose majority are vaccinated?', 'It’s too early to say for sure, but it’s possible a highly vaccinated population could reduce the variant’s transmissibility and the likelihood of severe illnesses and increased hospitalizations, said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium hospital in Mississauga, Ont.', '“It’s important to note that we can’t come to any strong conclusions about anything (right now),” Chakrabarti emphasized.', 'Omicron was first reported — but did not necessarily originate — in South Africa last week and, by Nov. 26, was designated a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization.', 'The concern, scientists say, lies in the total of 32 mutations found on its spike protein — the most recorded so far in a COVID-19 variant. Some of these mutations, experts say, bear similarities to those discovered in earlier variants, associated with higher transmissibility and higher likelihood of vaccine evasion.', 'It’ll take another couple of weeks before WHO officials can say how pathogenic the virus is but, in the meantime, they have warned that it could cause a “high global risk of infection surges.”', 'More than 20 countries — United Kingdom., Netherlands, Israel, Botswana, Sweden and Japan, to name a few — have confirmed Omicron cases, with some infections found in patients already vaccinated against COVID-19.', 'Thanks to a rigorous vaccination rollout in the past month, more than 78 per cent of Canadians are vaccinated, a minority of which are partially vaccinated. Which could, to an extent, spell hopeful news for Canadians.', 'Although it’s hard to be certain, It’s unlikely that the variant would completely “knock out the protection we get from the vaccines,” said Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease expert at Dalhousie University’s department of medicine.', 'Normally, when a body develops an immune response to a virus, either naturally or with the help of a vaccine, it creates a host of antibodies and T-cells that focus their attacks on different regions of the virus’s spike protein. Antibodies are proteins created by the immune system to neutralize a virus by blocking its ability to invade a cell, while T-cells, a type of white blood cell, kill the infected cells and coordinate the attacks.', 'Every COVID-19 vaccine targets the virus’ spike protein — the component that helps the virus penetrate a human cell — the most vital part of which is the receptor binding domain, a region on the protein that allows the virus to attach itself to the human cell before invading it.', 'Of the 32 mutations discovered on Omicron’s spike protein, the receptor binding domain is one of them, which means antibodies targeting that specific area may have a harder time fending the virus off its chosen cell.', 'But they could still be successful in their attacks on other regions of the spike protein that “aren’t as likely” to have mutated as much and that would still guarantee the vaccine some success against the variant, Barrett explained.', 'So, rather than no protection at all, the vaccine’s immunity may only be diminished by the mutations, but still effective, Barrett said.', 'It’s like using a dimmer switch to turn on the lights in a room — \xa0“If you have immunity, the dimmer will switch the light on,” she said. “The light might be a little dimmer, but it won’t necessarily go away altogether.”', 'Chakrabarti said it may not make a significant difference whether you’ve been dosed once or twice because it would take some time to see whether there is any difference in the immunity one gets from a single dose or a double dose against Omicron.', '“(But) I don’t think the difference will be huge,” he said.', 'Earlier this summer, long waits between the first and second shot, due to shortages in vaccine supplies, were found to inadvertently lengthen the immune response, strengthening the vaccine’s overall protection against the virus and its variants.\xa0 “(The single vaccine dose) certainly still will provide some degree of protection,” he said.', 'The quarter of Canadians who remain unvaccinated, however, may be a different story.', '“It depends on how much exposure they had to COVID-19,” Chakrabarti said. “But we also don’t know, if you’ve been naturally infected will that protection be less?”', 'Early reports, he said, appear to indicate a range of symptoms, from milder muscle aches, low-grade fever to terrible coughs and being of short breath in the ICU, the severity of which depends on a person’s vaccination status.', '“The one thing to remember is that the symptoms of the virus are just like any other virus,” he said. “And just in general, if you’re vaccinated, you’re less likely to have symptoms if you’re exposed.”', 'Canada’s high vaccination rate, he added, would not only potentially reduce symptoms of the virus, but also cut down on the variant’s communal spread and, most importantly, keep people out of hospital.', '“It’s difficult for the virus to spread very broadly,” Chakrabarti said. “Because there are so many people who are immune to it, they might still get symptoms, but you’re not all of a sudden seeing a blast of people in the hospital. And that’s really our primary concern — keeping people out of hospital.”', 'On Tuesday, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that he believes there may be a “material drop” in the vaccine’s efficacy against the virus, compared to that with Delta. ”\xa0I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like ‘this is not going to be good’,” Bancel said.', 'Global experts have already urged people to get their booster shot in the hopes of doubling protection against the virus.', '“I would strongly suggest you get boosted now and not wait for the next iteration of it, which we might not even need,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House, told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos Monday on Good Morning America, adding that he would “not at all” recommend waiting.', '“We’ll find out reasonably soon whether higher levels of antibody against the original vaccine that we’ve used, whether or not that can spill over in protection against this.”', 'But, if you’re already double-dosed, Barrett said she doubts that a third booster could do any better, especially when there is a lot unknown about how the virus would even respond to the vaccine.', '“There is some good rationale for boosting people who have waning immunity from what we knew before, and that’s good for Delta,” she said, “but to be clear we do not know that boosting the same vaccine is going to help us out here against Omicron.”', 'Instead she argued for ensuring effective public health measures to curtail the spread of the variant. “We really can’t forget the other measures, masking, testing, we just can’t do it,” she said. “We still have a large proportion of people who hang out together, namely children under 11, who haven’t been vaccinated yet. So it’s a little early for us to just let it all take over until we know more about Omicron.”']
