Vaccine switch after AstraZeneca first dose is safe, Canada's advisory panel says | National Post
['Canada’s vaccination committee has deemed it safe to pair AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot with a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna, the latest change in its thinking — leaving unanswered how much AstraZeneca may ultimately be wasted.', 'Early evidence suggests mixing COVID vaccines might prompt a more robust immune response, though it does increase the likelihood of temporary side effects like headache, fatigue and feeling generally ill.', 'Enabling people to swap doses “is expected to lead to increased accessibility and acceptability for those who were initially offered a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine,” ', 'To that end, the committee is making a “discretionary recommendation” that people who started with AstraZeneca be offered either the same for shot two, or a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster.', 'A week ago, NACI recommended sticking with the same vaccine when possible. While the real-word science on mixing is evolving, it’s a matter of “striking a balance,” Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, Howard Njoo, said Tuesday. “Because if you wait for further data, it may be too late, and you have to make a decision at some point.”', 'It’s not clear how the latest guidance will affect the uptake of AstraZeneca. Some people prefer sticking with AZ for both doses, and that option has been “retained,” said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer. However, she said people should look at “all the information in front of them about AstraZeneca.”', 'When asked how it could affect vaccine roll-out and whether she expects doses of AstraZeneca will end up having to be tossed out, Tam responded that “we don’t want to leave any vaccine doses unused, and that has to be minimized.', '“We will have to watch very closely what happens after this recommendation.… We don’t want to be ordering vaccines if we’re not using it. But that can only be ascertained in a more granular way when we see what the uptake looks like in the coming days,” she said.', 'Recent surveys suggest people are “more comfortable” with mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, NACI said. Given the risk of a rare blood clotting disorder dubbed VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, linked to AstraZeneca, it’s ethically justifiable, the group said, to offer an alternative vaccine with a more “acceptable” safety profile and comparable “immunogenicity,” meaning antibody response after vaccination.', 'Originally pegged at one in a million doses, then one in 250,000, the rate of VITT could be as high as one in 55,000, the panel said. The rate of VITT in the United Kingdom, after a second dose of AstraZeneca, is one in 600,000. But that, too, could change, officials said.', '“We’re all aware of this safety signal,” Njoo told reporters. “It’s rare, but if it does occur it’s serious.” Some people, based on their personal risk tolerance, will feel entirely comfortable completing their shots with AstraZeneca, just like millions have around the world, Njoo said. Others may not want to “tolerate” that risk.', 'NACI isn’t recommending using Pfizer and Moderna interchangeably, said Tam. “Try and use the same mRNA vaccine for the second dose, but if you can’t find it, or you don’t know what someone had … then another mRNA vaccine can be considered,” she said.', 'Either way, it’s vital that people go back for a second dose for “maximal” and longer duration of protection, she added.', 'Swapping out vaccines isn’t a new concept in science. It’s been done over decades with influenza, hepatitis A and other immunizations, as supplies change.', 'But there’s some nervousness about straying from the protocols used in the major COVID-19 vaccine trials. Outside France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, most jurisdictions in the world don’t actively recommend mixing COVID vaccines, though Manitoba is already offering Pfizer and Moderna boosters to people who got AstraZeneca.', '“You really have to treat it as experimental, something that needs to be monitored,” said Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University.', '“I think you want to consent people, to say, ‘we believe it’s safe, but we’re going to be following it, closely. We ask you to report side effects, adverse events.’ Some subsection needs to be followed, obviously, for immunity —\xa0how long it lasts and what’s going on.', '“There’s even a chance it could be better, I’m not denying that,” Caplan said. “I don’t say, ‘don’t try it,’ but really study it and really present it as something you’re going to monitor closely.”', 'More than two million Canadians received a first dose of AstraZeneca before provinces abruptly halted offering first doses last month. Several provinces have resumed offering it for second doses.', '“You either see the camp that says, ‘Just give me the damn second AstraZeneca dose, I’m willing to take it, I can understand the risk,” said Western University bioethicist Maxwell Smith. “And then there’s the other camp that is sort of looking for any other option.”', 'Mixing doses allows for greater flexibility, he said. “My reading of what NACI has recommended is really to say, ‘Look, we know mixing and matching might be a necessary strategy, given these disruptions in the vaccine supply. But that’s not to say we necessarily ought to be doing that, if we can avoid it.’”', 'Should COVID-19 become endemic, and continue to circulate seasonally, as many expect it will, people may need boosters every year. “In that case you’ll see different products used as third or fourth or fifth boosters,” Smith said. “We need to be thinking through, should it be the same produced we received for our first or second dose, or can we start to mix and match? This is beginning to answer those questions that we’re going to need to answer anyway.”', 'In making its recommendation, NACI considered studies from the U.K., Germany and Spain. In the unpublished Spanish trial — early results were presented in an online presentation only — a Pfizer booster seemed to “jolt” the immune systems of those who received AstraZeneca for their first shot, ', ' The AZ-Pfizer combination provoked an antibody response stronger than people generated after receiving two doses of AstraZeneca.', 'The COVID vaccines use different approaches. Pfizer and Moderna deliver genetic instructions that tell the body’s cells to start producing and pushing out harmless pieces of the spike protein found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. The cells make the protein piece, triggering an immune response and priming the immune system to attack the virus should the person later become infected with the virus. Tiny droplets of fat called lipid nanoparticles deliver the mRNA into human cells.', 'AstraZeneca uses a modified version of a cold-causing adenovirus to ferry the instructions for the spike protein to human cells.', '— — —', 'Canada is among the growing number of countries looking at switching to different COVID-19 vaccines for second doses amid supply delays and safety concerns that have slowed vaccination campaigns.', 'The following are countries that are weighing, or have decided to adopt, such a solution:', 'Chinese researchers in April were testing the mixing of COVID-19 vaccine doses developed by CanSino Biologics and a unit of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products , according to clinical trial registration data. China’s top disease control official said on April 12 the country was “formally considering” mixing vaccine doses developed with different technologies to boost their efficacy.', 'Finland’s Institute of Health and Welfare said on April 14 recipients of a first dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine who were younger than 65 might get a different shot for their second dose.', 'France’s top health advisory body has recommended in April that people under 55 injected with AstraZeneca first, should receive a second dose with a so-called messenger RNA vaccine, although dose-mixing has not yet been evaluated in trials.', 'Norway said on April 23 it would offer those who have received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine an injection with an mRNA vaccine as their second dose.', 'Russia put on hold the approval in the country of clinical trials combining AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines, after the health ministry’s ethical committee requested more data, AstraZeneca official told Reuters on May 28.', 'South Korea said on May 20 it would run a mix-and-match trial, mixing AstraZeneca doses with those developed by Pfizer and other drugmakers.', 'Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias said on May 19 the country would allow those under 60, who got an AstraZeneca shot first, to receive a second dose of either AstraZeneca or Pfizer’s vaccine. The decision followed preliminary results of a study by state-backed Carlos III Health Institute, which found that following up an AstraZeneca vaccine with a Pfizer shot was safe and highly effective.', 'Sweden’s health agency said on April 20 that people under 65, who have had one shot of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, would be given a different vaccine for their second dose.', 'Britain said in January it would allow people to be given a different vaccine for a second dose on extremely rare occasions, for example if the first vaccine was out of stock.', 'The first findings of an Oxford University-led study released on May 12 found that people who received Pfizer’s vaccine followed by a dose of AstraZeneca, or vice versa, were more likely to report mild or moderate common post-vaccination symptoms than if they received two doses of the same type.', 'Novavax said on May 21 it would take part in a mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine trial to test the use of an additional vaccine dose from a different producer as a booster. The trial will start in June in the United Kingdom', 'In January, CNBC reported the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had updated its guidance, allowing a mix of Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s shots with a gap of at least 28 days between the two shots, and in “exceptional situations.”']
