', 'An infection generally triggers a broad response in the respiratory tract where the virus circulates — the nose, throat and lungs, said Prasanna Jagannathan, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford. That puts an infected person at a lower Covid risk than someone who is unvaccinated and hasn’t been infected. ', 'the agency says. For mild infections that number might be closer to three months, according to ', '. ', 'Vaccine-induced immunity is more targeted and consistent. That means protection from the vaccine is far more reliable, and', ' said Ellen Foxman, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine. ', 'Two-dose vaccine immunity does wane after six months, but has continued to provide protection for most people against severe infection even with Delta. Early data suggests that Omicron is better at evading the vaccine’s defenses, but they’re not totally eliminated — and the protection against severe disease is still strong.', ' More than ', '. ', '“Sure, being previously infected does afford you some protection,” Foxman said. Unlike vaccines, which have been rigorously studied for effectiveness against variants, it’s more complicated to test the protectiveness of immunity from infection because everyone produces a different reaction to the virus and antibody tests are unreliable predictors of immunity. ', '“But are you really willing to gamble your health and the health of your loved ones when no one has studied your individual case?”', 'When the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine gets injected into an arm, particles in the muscle engineer an immune response that is focused on the spike protein, which keeps the virus from infecting a person’s cells, Jagannathan said. ', 'Intuitively, it may feel like a broad response that comes from infection would be better than a targeted response', 'from vaccination, but that hasn’t been the case, he said. Real-world data reveals the spike protein is especially important when it comes to protection against severe illness from new Covid variants. Researchers in his lab and others are still trying to figure out exactly why. ', 'said Melanie Ott, director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology.

That didn’t prevent the city of 2 million from experiencing a second Covid outbreak late last year and early this year, due to a new variant (Gamma) that sent people back to intensive care units even though they had been previously infected. ', 'Researchers are still trying to get a handle on how much immunity a Covid infection provides, but there’s just no reason for someone who recovered from Covid not to get a shot, Jagannathan said. Even though the mechanisms are different, ', 'Barouch said.', 'Early evidence from South Africa suggests that prior ', '“The infection provides some protection,” Ott said, “but with the vaccine it’s a super shot.” ', 'Reach out with news, tips and ideas at ', '.

Experts say it would improve health on both sides of the bars. And that could help them stay out of prison, instead of going right back inside.', 'People in jails and prisons have more chronic disease —', 'conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, hepatitis and TB — and very high rates of behavioral health problems like addiction and mental illness. Covid has also ravaged prisons. The risk of death and hospitalization in the first weeks out is many times higher than other people’s. And health challenges, mental or physical, raise the odds that they boomerang right back to the courthouse.', ' said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University law professor and Medicaid expert. People without the right medical support, particularly for mental and behavioral health, are just more likely to get in trouble all over again. ', 'It was the risk of overdose in particular, and the opportunity to help people with substance abuse disorders or other mental illnesses to get into treatment in the community before they relapse, that propelled the proposal known as the Medicaid Re-entry Act, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who was one of the original co-sponsors, said in an interview with Nightly.', '“Historically, we used criminal models for drug addiction rather than a public health model in addressing addiction and substance use disorder,” Baldwin said. “This gives us an opportunity to pivot.”', '(though a separate BBB provision would close the Medicaid gap that has left poor people without coverage in the dozen states that reject Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion). Many people in jails and prisons are Medicaid-eligible, because of poverty, disability or both. But their coverage gets cut off while they are behind bars. And it doesn’t turn on automatically when people are released. In fact, it can take weeks to get coverage back in place.', 'Establishing continuity in health coverage before their release —', 'what’s called a “warm handoff” into community care —', 'can make a big difference. “It’s a very big change for criminal justice, and has the potential to improve public safety goals,” said Vikki Wachino, who ran Medicaid near the end of the Obama administration and has since done a lot of work on this re-entry challenge. “When leaving prisons and jails, having supports including health care means people are more likely to rejoin families, participate in communities and not return to jail or prison.”', ' that can get them re-settled and off to a decent start in the community. People reentering the community, particularly if they’ve been incarcerated for so many years that their connections to the outside are attenuated, juggle multiple needs; housing, employment, connecting to parole officers and the like. Health care may get shoved to the bottom of the list, with a whole lot of very bad consequences. Some states, notably Ohio, have already begun testing ways of getting people pre-release care, and it’s seen as promising enough to take it national. ', 'Release, however welcome, is a high-risk moment. Sometimes prisoners are let out in the middle of the night, without drugs they need — insulin, mental health medications, or anti-addiction medicines, said Dan Mistak, director of health initiatives at Community Oriented Correction Health Services. For anyone who has stayed off drugs while incarcerated, relapse is common and overdose is a high risk. Even someone who tries to recalibrate to a lower dose after prolonged abstention, often makes a fatal miscalculation.', ' and it’s a state option, not a mandate. Still it’s likely that most states, across the political spectrum, would adopt it within the next few years. Continuity is preferable to having newly-released people “dropped with no parachute” on Medicaid’s lap, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. But putting pre-release Medicaid in place is complicated, and may not look the same in every state, noted the association’s federal policy director Jack Rollins. There’s a lot to work out, including data flow. “Correctional facilities systems are not designed to talk to Medicaid,” noted Rollins.', 'But as Wachino pointed out: “Past criminal justice reforms” — the Prison Rape Elimination Act and the Second Chance Act, both signed by George W. Bush; the First Step Act signed by Donald Trump — “have been driven on the Hill by an interest in redemption. And I think that potential is here with the Re-entry Act.
