Tale of two vaccine roll-outs: COVID-19 numbers plummet in Toronto’s long-term-care homes, while Ontario’s remain ‘stubbornly high’ | The Star
['After being at the centre of COVID-19 deaths and mass outbreaks, the city’s long-term-care homes have new, hopeful data that could be a sign of encouraging things to come.', 'This week, Toronto Public Health reported a “substantial decline” in the rate seniors have tested positive in long-term-care homes, from 10.9 per cent in November to just 0.6 per cent as of the week of Feb. 7 — well below the overall city rate of 4.8 per cent. ', 'It was the “first sign” Mayor John Tory said this week that the city’s vaccination efforts were working.', 'In the 10 homes the city of Toronto runs, there was just a single staff person that tested positive recently and zero residents who had COVID-19.', '“This week was the first week where we actually saw zeroes for a short period of time, which was just so striking for us,” said Paul Raftis, the head of Toronto’s senior care. Caring for the city’s most vulnerable has kept him up at night. Now, the falling numbers have brought a huge wave of relief. ', '“There really isn’t words for it.”', 'That sharp decline comes just a week after the city celebrated the successful completion of vaccination of more than 10,000 residents across all 87 of the city’s LTCs — public, non-profit and for-profit.', 'It took 47 days to fully roll out two doses of vaccines to residents. Staff and essential caregivers are still in the process of being vaccinated.', 'When vaccines are available, Toronto’s hospital teams responsible for administering them have proven hundreds of doses can be successfully rolled out in a matter of days.', 'Raftis said as of this week that the vast majority of residents — 95 per cent — have been vaccinated.', 'Going forward, he said it’s important they not let their guard down.', 'Rapid antigen testing has been implemented in half of the city-run homes and he hopes to see everyone tested everyday as part of additional prevention measures.', 'The rapid test can screen visitors to the home within 15 minutes and anyone screened positive is sent home to isolate and asked to book a lab test to confirm.', 'Of 7,000 recent screens, 11 people were positive, Raftis said, but not all were confirmed positive through lab testing. This process, he said, has increased their ability to help identify potential threats and mitigate spread.', '“We don’t want to let our guard down on this,” he said. “We’re cautiously optimistic.”', 'While the situation in Toronto is a good news story, said Dr. Samir Sinha, the director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai hospital in Toronto, there have been delays in getting the rest of the province’s vulnerable seniors vaccinated.', 'In a paper ', ', Sinha and his co-authors detail how the federal government has delivered equal doses on a per capita basis to each province and territory. While there were a sufficient number of doses to give the initial shot to Ontario’s entire LTC population by late December, it has lagged behind other provinces.', '“As of January 5, 2021 fewer than 4,000 (5.5%) of Ontario’s 72,000 LTC residents had been given an initial dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, and over 26,000 (26%) of its more than 100,000 LTC staff,” the study says. “British Columbia, by comparison, had given a first dose to over 4,700 (20%) of its LTC residents and 11,600 (50%) of its LTC staff by January 4, 2021.”', 'The result, Sinha told the Star, is a “stubbornly high” number of provincial homes in outbreak.', 'He said what they have learned so far from vaccinated homes is optimistic — the vaccines appear to be as effective in older adults as younger citizens.', '“When you see that COVID-19 just seems to be melting away … it really has been a good news story,” he said. But it also “really emphasizes why Ontario needs to step up its game and get all residents in all congregate settings vaccinated.”', 'TPH reported this week on a recent Public Health Scotland study that showed the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 by as much as 85 per cent by the fourth week of receiving the first dose and up to 80 per cent for those aged 80 and over.', '“This is extremely good news,” said Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s medical officer of health. “It demonstrates the effectiveness of the vaccine and the efforts by so many people and organizations to drive down spread and protect the people living in long-term care and retirement homes.”', 'She noted vaccines are not the only reason for progress.', '“I don’t think that takes away from the many practices, infection prevention and control practices, and all the efforts that have been put in to reducing the potential for transmission of COVID-19 within long-term-care homes,” she said, and pointed to the need for several different measures in order to get back to normal life.', 'It’s too soon to say whether visitation rules could be relaxed, de Villa said, and current advice is to continue to follow hand-washing, distancing and other protocols.', "What do you think about Ontario's vaccine roll-out so far?", 'Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.
