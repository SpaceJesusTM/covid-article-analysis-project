Why it can be hard to prove a vaccine caused a bad outcome | National Post
['Doctors in Canada who willfully refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19 should be prohibited from seeing patients in person, ', ' this week. There is “robust” evidence, wrote the authors of the editorial published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, to rebut claims the vaccines are experimental or unsafe, and while the vaccine-resistant are free to choose not to be inoculated, “they ought not to be free to refuse SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and to work as physicians.”', 'Tens of millions of doses into the pandemic vaccine campaign in Canada, and serious reported “adverse events” are rare. Which ones are known to carry a mortality risk? Anaphylaxis, a rare allergic reaction that can occur within minutes of needle piercing skin can be fatal, if not recognized early enough and treated quickly. VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a rare blood clotting phenomenon linked to AstraZeneca and J&J, adenoviral vector vaccines, “can be very persistent and malignant,” said Dr. Donald Arnold, medical director of McMaster University’s Platelet Immunology Laboratory, ', ' “It just can get worse and worse, and sometimes people end up with very bad outcomes, including death.”', 'With VITT, a diagnostic test checks for an unusual antibody against platelets produced by the vaccine. It is one scenario “where I feel like we can say with confidence that this entity is causally related to the vaccine,” Arnold said.', 'In many others, it can be “fiendishly challenging,” ', ' , to prove that a rare but severe or fatal “event” that occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination was actually caused by a vaccine itself. Here are some reasons why.', 'A serious adverse drug reaction is defined, according to Health Canada, as a “noxious and unintended response to a drug” that puts someone in hospital, causes birth defects, disability or incapacity and is life-threatening or ends in death.', 'Doctors, nurses and pharmacists fill out an AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization) form that includes check boxes for reactions such as “angioedema,” or swelling of the tongue, throat, eyelids, face or lips; respiratory reactions such as wheezing or shortness of breath; and gastrointestinal problems. The “outcome at time of report” boxes include fully recovered, not yet recovered, permanent disability or death.', 'But reports aren’t proof of causation. The Public Health Agency of Canada conducts medical reviews “to determine the likelihood that a vaccine was associated with an adverse event,” the agency said in an email. Primary medical reviewers flag cases that require a second review, and an expert level assessment is conducted via a newly established Advisory Committee on Causality Assessment on “select cases.”', ' , a total of 208 reports of death following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine had been reported through the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System, or CAEFISS, and Health Canada’s Canada Vigilance Program. Of those, 79 deaths were deemed unlikely linked to a COVID vaccine, 82 deaths lacked sufficient information to make an assessment and 47 were still under investigation. Seven of those deaths involved the blood clotting complication.', 'The median age of the 208 reports with an outcome of death was 74 (range 12 to 102), with 61 per cent more than 70 years of age. The median time from vaccination to death was eight days. “Out of the reports that contain sufficient information, at least 85 per cent have an underlying medical condition documented,” the agency said.', '“The benefits of vaccines authorized in Canada continue to outweigh the risks,” PHAC said. “We’ll respond to any safety issues right away and will inform Canadians about any risks that arise in Canada.”', 'More than 59 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Canada. Nationally, as of Oct. 29, there had been just over 22,200 reports of adverse reactions following immunization; of those, 5,653 were reported as serious (0.010 per cent of all doses given by that time).', 'As of Tuesday, there were 29,203 reported COVID-related deaths in Canada, 1.7 million confirmed cases and just under 90,000 hospitalizations.', 'In Canada, vaccine safety surveillance was scaled up for COVID-19 shots. “There has been rapid communication of new adverse events related to new safety concerns,” said Dr. Karina Top, an infectious diseases doctor at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax and investigator with the ', ' . With myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle and the lining of the heart — two complications that have been reported in higher numbers than would normally be expected after vaccination with an mRNA vaccine — the provinces issued updated preliminary reports of cases, Top said, pushing the information out to doctors so they could be aware of the safety signal and report cases. Reports of all suspected adverse events are being published weekly. ', ' , a\xa0children’s\xa0hospital-based one set up over 20 years,\xa0captures reported adverse reactions in children.', 'In the U.S. more than 423 million doses of COVID vaccines were given from December 2020 through to Nov. 1, 2021. During that time, the ', ' \xa0received 9,367 reports of death, or 0.0022 per cent of all doses administered. Healthcare providers in the U.S. are required to report any death after COVID-vaccination to VAERS, “even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.” But anyone can file a report to VAERS, some of which can be anecdotal or based on second-hand information. U.S. health officials have said the only “plausible” causal link between COVID-19 vaccines and deaths so far is with the rare blood clots.', 'Under the British government’s\xa0 ', ' the public can report suspected side effects from vaccines. According to the most recent weekly summary, 1,739 reports have been submitted of people who died shortly after receipt of a COVID vaccine, the majority of them elderly people or people with heart, kidney or other chronic health problems. “Review of individual reports and patterns of reporting does not suggest the vaccines played a role in these deaths,” according to the summary. More than 107 million doses of COVID vaccines have been administered in the U.K.', '“Really, the key there, when you have a fatal outcome is, what was the cause of death? What was the diagnosis, the condition, that led to the fatal outcome,” Top said. “In a younger, healthy person who died suddenly, that may be easy to tease out compared to someone who is very elderly and has a number of different conditions.”', 'Investigators review reports, doctors’ notes, medical records and death certificates to rule out “coincidental” events that might have occurred regardless of the vaccination. A drug reaction might make an underlying medical condition worse, and contribute to the death. “Obviously the physician who sees the patient is in the best position to say,” Top said. “People who die at home, that information may be more limited.”', 'Some reactions are obvious: Anaphylaxis that starts 15 minutes after vaccination would be much more likely to be associated with the vaccine than anaphylaxis that starts 30 days later.', 'The bigger challenge is that “most of the conditions, pretty well all the conditions, that can occur with adverse events following vaccination can also be triggered by other things,” Top said. Guillain-Barre syndrome, where the person’s immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis, is associated with food poisoning, influenza and with a COVID infection itself. “It very, very rarely may be a higher risk with the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Top said. It becomes weighing probabilities: did a recent infection trigger it, or the vaccine?', 'Again, a report doesn’t prove cause-and-effect. Most provinces mandate reporting of certain serious adverse events. “So if there is a fatal outcome following vaccination without a clear other cause — for example, someone got hit by a car on their way home from a vaccine appointment and they died — they are mandated to report that,” Top said.', 'All deaths “temporally associated” with vaccination are reported to public health units and thoroughly investigated,\xa0 according to Public Health Ontario. As of Oct. 24, there were 30 reports of deaths classified as “persons under investigation” in the province. The investigations are ongoing and additional information, including an autopsy or coroner’s report, is expected. “There has been no association with vaccine identified at this time,” according to Public Health Ontario.', 'The “passive” surveillance system exists to cast a very wide net, Top said. “For the most part, healthcare providers are encouraged to report anything where they have a concern, regardless of the time interval.” But symptoms should develop within four to six weeks after the vaccination. Much later than that, and it’s unlikely it had anything to do with the vaccine. Rare cases of the blood-clotting syndrome have occurred several days to up to three-and-a-half weeks after being vaccinated with J&J or AstraZeneca. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis typically happen within one to five days, most often after the second dose and most often in younger men under 30.']
