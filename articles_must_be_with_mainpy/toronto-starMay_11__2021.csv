Why pregnant people should consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine | The Star
['“Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for me and my baby?”', 'This is a question that we hear often among pregnant patients, family, friends, and community members. Recently, pregnant Ontarians were moved up the prioritization list in the province’s vaccine rollout as regions across Canada battle a challenging third wave of COVID-19. The spread of more transmissible variants of COVID-19 has pushed our healthcare resources beyond capacity, filled our intensive care units with younger people, and led to further tragic loss of human lives. ', 'This third wave is also marked by an increase in the number of hospitalized pregnant patients with COVID-19 requiring critical care. The best protection against COVID-19 illness is immunity acquired through vaccination. Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines are encouraged during pregnancy in Canada:', 'COVID-19 has been particularly harmful for pregnant people and their newborns. A recent paper that compiled data from multiple studies of COVID-19 infections found that COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and ICU admission during ', '. Furthermore, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy increases risk of preterm birth, neonatal intensive care and fetal distress. A recently published multinational study also found a higher risk of severe disease and death in ill pregnant people and their newborns when ', ' to those without COVID-19.', 'The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) issued a statement on April 20 recognizing that pregnancy is associated with ', ' of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death following COVID-19 infection. The SOGC states that all available COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in Canada should be considered in any trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding. These vaccines have been safe and effective at preventing severe disease and death due to COVID-19 in clinical trials and in real-world settings.', 'Vaccines that contain a live, weakened virus are not recommended during pregnancy due to risk of infection in the developing fetus. However, none of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada contain live viruses. Instead, these vaccines introduce the recipe for the spike protein present on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, allowing our immune system to develop antibodies and immune memory against that protein. ', 'Although the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines do contain a virus, this modified Adenovirus cannot replicate and therefore is incapable of causing an infection. For more information on vaccination during pregnancy, see the “', '.”', 'Pregnant people living in communities with high COVID-19 cases and high levels of transmission, for example, in Toronto or Peel, have a higher chance of encountering the virus, especially if they or a household member needs to leave home for work or if they live in multigenerational homes. The benefit of getting protection as soon as a vaccine is offered outweighs the risk of waiting due to the chance of contracting COVID-19 while pregnant. ', 'During pregnancy, antibodies from the expecting parent are passed onto the developing baby through the placenta. Newborn babies maintain this passive (acquired) immunity for the first few months of life as their own immune system develops. Emerging ', ' has demonstrated that this phenomenon can also occur for ', ' developed in response to COVID-19 vaccination, which suggests newborns can acquire ', ' against COVID-19. ', 'There is growing evidence from published studies on safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. A preliminary report of data from the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System regarding safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines ', ' any safety concerns in 35,691 vaccinated pregnant individuals.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted inequities that befall pregnant people, particularly during ', '. Pregnant people often face unique vulnerabilities during disease outbreaks, as was evident during the ', ' and 2009 influenza (H1N1) ', ', despite advancement in modern medical care. ', 'Encouraging and prioritizing vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy is essential for protecting the health and livelihood of expecting parents and newborns. Going forward, inclusion of pregnant people in clinical trials can put a focus on informing and empowering both the clinicians and pregnant persons on health decisions during pregnancy.']
