COVID vaccine not mandatory, health-care workers 'encouraged' to get | Vancouver Sun
['Health-care workers who decline the COVID-19 vaccination will need to continue to follow strict guidelines around health checks and the use of personal protective equipment, according to the B.C. Ministry of Health.', 'In a statement Friday, the ministry said B.C. doesn’t have mandatory immunization programs, including for the COVID-19 vaccine, but health-care workers are being “encouraged” to get it.', 'The statement said the vaccine provides “good protection for seniors, meaning they are protected regardless of the health-care worker’s immunization.”', 'There are 51 active outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities in B.C. as of Thursday, as well as 10 in acute care. The outbreaks involve 2,333 people, including 1,501 residents and 752 staff with active cases.', 'A ', ' \xa0conducted in December found that 57 per cent of workers planned to get the vaccine, while 28 per cent were unsure and 15 per cent didn’t intend to get it.', 'Conducted by SafeCare B.C., the survey was disseminated to care workers through both the B.C. Nurses’ Union and the B.C. Government Employees’ Union, and had received 1,500 replies as of Dec. 18.', 'Respondents over age 65 were more likely to say yes to the vaccine, while those in the 24-to-34 age group were the least certain, with 20 per cent saying no and 30 per cent unsure. Survey feedback indicated this could be related to concerns about pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility. Men were more likely to say yes than women.', 'CEO Jennifer Lyle said the results of the survey weren’t a surprise as they tend to track with what the public is feeling.', '“There is always going to be early adopters and those with more questions,” she said.', 'The association, which advocates for safe working conditions for continuing-care providers, is working to get answers to people with questions on the vaccine’s safety and testing standards.', '“The good news is that there are answers to those questions,” said Lyle.', 'She didn’t know what policies would need to be put in place to protect workers and residents if large numbers of care workers decline to get the vaccine, but suggested one thing that could increase safety was rapid testing.', 'B.C. Nurses’ Union president Christine Sorensen said the union is encouraging all of its members to be vaccinated, but it doesn’t believe in mandatory vaccination.', '“We must respect individual choice,” she said, emphasizing the need for informed consent when administering any medication.', 'Sorensen said education is key to helping nurses, as well as the public, feel confident giving consent.', '“A person who chooses not to get it now might be less reluctant in a month or a year,” she said.', 'There will also be some nurses who won’t be vaccinated for other reasons, including pregnancy or religious reasons.', '“For those who cannot, we expect they’ll be able to work in other areas or be redeployed,” she said. “This is done all the time for those that can’t take the flu shot when there’s an outbreak of influenza in a facility.”', 'Sorensen said her inbox has been inundated with letters from nurses who are concerned that they won’t be able to get the second dose of the vaccine on schedule. Waiting too long for the second dose would be contrary to instructions from the vaccine manufacturer or “off-label use,” she said.', '“Nurses and the general public must feel confident that science is leading the vaccine effort,” she said. “Otherwise that can lead to vaccine hesitancy.”', 'In early December, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry strongly encouraged people in health-care settings to get the vaccine, adding, “if people are thinking of going into those settings and don’t believe in immunization, then they should look for other things to do.”', 'On Thursday, she said the province’s immunization efforts for the next week or two will focus on “seniors and elders, and those who care for them.”', 'Health Minister Adrian Dix said B.C.’s work in long-term care relative to other jurisdictions has been good, but “I don’t think that people going through any of these outbreaks … is really that concerned about how they’re doing in Ontario or Quebec. They are worried about their family, their loved one, their community, their care home — and so am I.”', 'He said the “overwhelming majority” of vaccinations in B.C. so far have been for people in long-term care and those who work there.']
