My mom says she’ll refuse the COVID-19 vaccine. Why? She was once neglected by Canada’s health system when she almost lost her life. How can she trust them now? | The Star
['Two years ago, while on a hospital gurney, my mother told me that she had to be cynical to be Black and survive in this country. ', 'With scent of antiseptic wafting in the air and alarms blaring out codes and directions, she took the hectic moment to explain that there was a part of you — or her, anyway — that would always want to feel safe here but expect to be disappointed. You would love to trust the law, even as the regularity of police brutality built up your reasons not to. And that someday you’d find a health care system that was indifferent to your pain, putting a stop to the belief that it was ever really designed for you. ', 'That day, at the age of 66, my mom experienced a hypertensive crisis; a case when high blood pressure reaches the point of being fatal. Despite complaining of chest pains and severe headaches, my mom was neglected, and unattended until she vomited on a receptionist’s desk, and was rushed to an emergency room. To this day, I can’t forget how close she came to losing her life, and based on her most recent views — to refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine when her time comes — my mom hasn’t forgotten either. ', 'Her distrust in government is an age-old story for Black and Indigenous people — one backed by a historical and everyday context. Far from the tired, disingenuous concerns of no-mask, tinfoil wearing anti-vaxxers, the 1932 U.S', ' did happen. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, the federal government of Canada', ' where vaccine experimentation was conducted without consent. This is just one of many examples, and still, not much has changed. Fast forward to 2020,', ', an Atikamekw woman, died in Quebec from equal parts racism, abuse and neglect. And', ' remains a problem without an accepted solution. ', 'All this — with claims of anti-racism and progressive tolerance in our nation — is incongruent to a country that says it cares for our lives. Because we’ve been told that fairy tale for some time now. And mom’s skepticism is just a byproduct of that lie; when Canada’s idealism doesn’t sound right, read right, or feel right. ', 'There’s a limit to how much some of us can buy into a vaccine when we’re equipped with only so much information. My mom isn’t a medical professional, and when she strolls into a local hospital, she has to place a measure of trust in a country that, in connection to her experience, hasn’t prioritized her Black life. ', 'On one hand, this government sees fit to provide an antigen that can save all lives. But on another, the fact that', ' in Toronto, means that my mom is economically more vulnerable in a way that could have been addressed, if someone cared. Actions around defunding the police in the interest of guarding her life would have happened by now, if someone cared. And this government would openly acknowledge racism as the core of her vaccine hesitancy, if they cared. All of these factors existed in concert with the reality that she’s been living with systemic racism, and has been more likely to die by it well before COVID-19 had ever been a thing. ', 'When recently I spoke with Dr. Naheed Dosani, a palliative care physician and health justice advocate, about this very issue, he summed it up perfectly. ', '“At every step of the way, we’ve seen that a one size fits all approach to pandemic public health messaging doesn’t work,” he said. “There’s no greater time to take an anti-racist and equity informed approach to vaccine rollout. If we don’t address these systematic issues for the sake of people like your mom, there’s a chance that we won’t see the uptake we need to get us past COVID-19.”', 'Meanwhile, the best version of a government response is an avalanche of information with the dual purpose of avoidance. If I visit the front page of', ' for example, there won’t be information about implicit bias, or mentions of race. A lack of that data says less about this issue not existing and more about the stats they’ve time and again chosen to neglect. ', 'My mom is the most important person in this world to me. Everything else can exist because she still does. But I can’t prove that what happened to her two years ago, rejected while pleading for help in the hospital, won’t happen again. I can’t soften her concerns when they aren’t acknowledged beyond empty statements. I can’t prove to her that a lifetime of eroded trust can be corrected without admittance. ', 'As much as it pains me, I know that she’s acting on what she’s always felt she’s had to do on her own in Canada: survive. ']
