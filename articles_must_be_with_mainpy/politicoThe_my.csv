The myth about women and the Covid-19 vaccine that won’t die - POLITICO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
['By ', '\xa0', 'One group of Americans is particularly resistant to getting a Covid-19 vaccine: Women. In an early March ', ' conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66 percent of women said they planned to get a vaccine or had already had at least one dose, compared to 72 percent of men. Sixty-six percent is a majority, to be sure, but it falls far below the 75-80 percent target often cited by health researchers as the threshold for herd immunity.', 'It might come as a surprise that women, who have been earning most college degrees since the 1980s and who are more liberal on most issues than men, would be particularly hesitant to be vaccinated. (Republican men are still the ', ' when considering party affiliation and gender, followed by Republican women and then Democratic women.) But anti-vaxxer communities have long been associated with women, particularly parents who fear vaccines might trigger side effects in their children. Studies have ', ' that women make up the “vast majority” of online anti-vaxxers. ', ' When it comes to Covid-19, misinformation that the vaccines cause infertility has been a key driver of vaccine hesitancy among women. This theory gained traction late last year when a group ', ' a petition to a German website, speculating without evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines then in development could affect infertility. One of the authors of the petition was a former vice president of Pfizer, which lent the petition credibility, especially in anti-vaxx circles. Despite medical experts’ widespread debunking of this myth, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from January showed that ', ' of those polled who were unvaccinated had heard it. ', 'The myth is a potent one. “Talking about someone’s fertility is particularly alarming,” said Amelia Jamison, a qualitative researcher and doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University who has studied the spread of anti-vaccination messaging online.', 'According to Jamison, two different kinds of infertility messaging around vaccines have been common on social media and other information channels, patterns that predated the pandemic but apply to Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. There are the conspiracy theories about how vaccines are part of a population control plan, and then there “is more subtle stuff that’s inside the anti-vaccine community, like an article talking about possible impacts on a woman’s fertility stemming from the HPV vaccine, or that women who get flu shots are more likely to miscarry.” The first, Jamison said, are more outrageous and clickbait-y. The second kind of misinformation, though, is more insidious: It can often draw on real research, even if it misinterprets results or overlooks evidence.', 'Jamison and her colleagues were struck by how fast anti-vaxxers adapted their messaging to Covid-19. They “didn’t even need evidence, because they were just revamping the narrative they’ve used in the past to fit the newer evidence as it emerges,” she said. In a way, the pandemic created the ideal opening for this playbook that had already been perfected in recent decades. “In that space where people are uncertain, I think this kind of certainty is appealing.” ', 'Covid-19 has also revealed that this heavily female group is more diverse, more powerful and perhaps harder to understand than people thought before Covid-19. Pre-pandemic, “many people thought anti-vaxxers were this sort of laughable group,” she says. “And now we’re seeing that it’s much broader and it can have a much bigger impact.”', ' I moderated a Politico panel this week on the challenges women face in the workplace. It made me realize how much we’re missing out on conversations like these in the new work-from-home world a lot of us are living in. You know those kinds of conversations—when a group of women break off during a work happy hour and talk about how they should ', ' deal with that problem that’s been bothering them for a while. ', 'We discussed how many of our panelists weren’t able to start feeling comfortable until they embraced their real selves in the workplace and dropped the “fake it ‘til you make it” advice; how striking up casual friendships is usually the best way to initiate a mentor-mentee relationship; and the need to step out of your comfort zone on a regular basis.

And women’s overall successes in 2022 specifically are likely to hinge on Republican efforts since midterm elections historically favor the party not in the White House, the report noted.” ', ' via ', ' ...

Some 270 million women around the world had unmet needs for modern contraceptives before the pandemic. Poverty and stigma are major factors in this and are exacerbated by geopolitics. The United States’ ‘Mexico City Policy,’ known by critics as the ‘global gag rule’ and recently overturned by President Biden, for years also blocked organizations that receive U.S. funding from providing abortion services or information related to abortion. Research shows that stricter contraceptive laws under French colonial rule mean that today, people in former French colonies have a harder time accessing contraception than those living in former British colonies, which had looser regulations.', '“Women who didn’t mean to get pregnant face a host of elevated risk factors, including increased maternal health complications like postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia, fewer prenatal care appointments and a higher incidence of mental health problems. Women are three times as likely to have an unintended pregnancy in low-income countries, where 94 percent of maternal deaths occur (the majority in sub-Saharan Africa).', '“Although unintended pregnancies have fallen worldwide since the 1990s as access to contraceptives have increased, global health professionals worry that as the pandemic cleaves the global wealth gap wider, those gains could evaporate. ‘The estimates we have don’t tell the full story of what will happen with long-term economic changes the pandemic has caused,’ said Jennie Greaney, a technical specialist at UNFPA. ‘Many women are paying out of pocket [for contraceptives] and whether they can afford that long term as economies are shrinking will be another question.’” ', 'via ', 'via ', ' ...', 'via ', ' ...', ' via ', ' by Lindsay Crouse: “Watching the recent surge of women’s sports enthusiasts clamoring to save female athletes from the transgender rights movement, it’s hard not to feel a little wistful. So this is what it’s like to matter. This year, lawmakers in more than 20 states have introduced legislation to ban transgender kids from girls’ sports, under the guise of protecting women and girls. Bills have already passed in Mississippi and Idaho. The quest to block trans girls from competition has some prominent supporters. ...', '“But all this new passion has made me wonder, what if all these people claiming to be fighting for the future of women’s sports would really fight for the future of women’s sports? What if they suddenly said, ‘We demand women’s sports get equal resources, equal media coverage, and equal pay’? What if these new activists embraced women’s sports and invested in female athletes, instead of using us as their excuse for transphobia? This controversy hurts, because female athletes of all backgrounds have been spending decades fighting for equal treatment — and we are still far from winning. The conversation is disingenuous, patronizing and often racist. Using our struggle to score political points is a distraction.” ', 'by Oranicha Jumreornvong: “Growing up as a queer woman in Thailand, a homogeneous country marred by military dictatorships, censorships and bloody coups, I was used to violence. So when I immigrated to the United States in 2014 for college and medical school, I saw this country as a safe haven. Unfortunately, that sense of security was shattered when I was assaulted and robbed in broad daylight.', '“I now realize that my experience was part of a broader pattern of anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States, which have increased by 150 percent since the start of the pandemic. These xenophobic acts are in part due to the perception that Asians are to blame for the pandemic. They have rippled throughout the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, including among health professionals who have described being attacked on the streets by strangers or even harassed by patients they cared for during the pandemic.', '“And last week, that violence came to a head with the shootings at Atlanta spas that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women. I was treating a transgender woman’s wounds after she was violently beaten with a bat when I learned of the Atlanta shooting from other health professionals. After the patient was stabilized, I excused myself and cried in the on-call room. So many emotions ran through my body, but the worst was the absence of one: I wasn’t surprised by the violence against and sexualization of women, especially Asian women. ', '“I’d long experienced it myself. Back home in Thailand, I was only 10 when a White man in his 50s approached me with candies. He asked if I wanted them in exchange for oral sex. When I refused and ran away, he approached another young girl nearby. I had buried the memories of that foreign man until the suspected Atlanta shooter blamed his sexual addiction for the killing of those Asian women.” ', ' via ', ' ...

How America’s top agents, soldiers, diplomats, intelligence analysts and elected officials failed to anticipate and uncover the buildup of a nuclear arsenal on America’s doorstep, less than 100 miles off the coast, is still being studied and debated. At best, the story of American intelligence activities before and during the crisis is far from complete. One of the most extraordinary omissions to date is the central role played by [Juanita] Moody, a 38-year-old code-breaking whiz and the head of the NSA’s Cuba desk during the perilous fall of 1962. Even today her name is largely unknown outside the agency, and the details of her contributions to the nation’s security remain closely guarded.” ', 'by Ko Bragg: “Since Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B’s ‘WAP’ debuted last summer to critical acclaim, conservative politicians and far-right media figures have used it to lambast feminism and rap, claiming the explicit nature of the song — with its sex-positive lyrics and a decadent video to match — was a threat to children, especially young girls. Last weekend at the 63rd Grammy Awards, Megan and Cardi took to the stage to perform the song live for the first time. The panic reignited. The Federal Communication Commission received approximately 80 complaints about the ‘WAP’ performance from viewers, reports say. Megan and Cardi did their own dance numbers before joining together on one stage, where they locked legs for a few counts. ', '“Aria S. Halliday, an assistant professor of gender studies at the University of Kentucky who writes about the political significance of feminism in hip-hop, expected the fallout. What Megan and Cardi provide in their artistry, Halliday says, is a sense of agency that women in hip-hop have exuded for decades amid intercommunal scrutiny and political debate. But Halliday argues that beyond hip-hop, women like Megan and Cardi provide a ‘counterpoint’ to women who are touted as more obvious role models, like Michelle Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris. ‘I think it’s really important that we talk about the ways that we hold up certain figures as the ones to model ourselves off of,’ Halliday said. ‘But they can’t exist without these other so-called “negative representations.” So you can’t have Michelle Obama without Cardi in a lot of ways.’” ', ' via ', ' ...
