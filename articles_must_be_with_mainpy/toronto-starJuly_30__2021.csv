Sharon Stone and Sean Penn are correct: getting vaccinated against COVID-19 isn’t about personal freedom — it’s about community safety | The Star
['Sharon Stone only wants to work with people who are vaccinated.', 'While Hollywood sets rarely mirror other workplaces, this basic instinct has resonance. Currently running for a position on the SAG-AFTRA board, the actress revealed she was offered a job on a show to be shot in Atlanta. That gig is allegedly now in jeopardy due to her demand that all cast and crew be inoculated. No exceptions.', '“I’ve been offered a job, a good job, a job I really want to do in Atlanta,” Stone says in a recent campaign video, according to Deadline. “That’s why my hair is standing on end … because the Producers Guild of America will not guarantee that everyone on our show is vaccinated before I go to work.”', 'She then used the Socratic method to arrive at her conclusion.', '“Will I go to work before everyone on my show is vaccinated? No. No, I won’t. Am I being threatened that I will lose my job? Yes. Yes, I am. Will I lose my job if everyone is not vaccinated on my show? Yes. Yes, I could. Will I stand up for all of us so that every set that we go on is vaccinated? Yes. Yes, I will. Why? Because that’s ridiculous … that we should have to go to work where we are not safe to work.”', 'She’s not alone. Earlier this month, Sean Penn said he would not return to “Gaslit,” a Watergate drama, unless all involved had received the jab. Just based on his pro-mask tirades on the set of “Mission: Impossible 7,” I suspect Tom Cruise will also include a “100 Per Cent Vaccinated Set” rider in future contracts. ', 'Stars can make these demands. If The Rock says boo about safety, his overlords will listen in a way they won’t if that ultimatum comes from Julia in craft services.', 'But what about the rest of us who lack the clout of Meryl Streep or Michael B. Jordan?', 'How do we return to offices and co-exist with those who refuse to get vaccinated?', 'I have ', ' tried to do a deep dive in empathetic scuba gear to understand why some are hesitant to roll up their sleeves. I still don’t get it. If anything, the anti-vaxxer arguments — especially “personal freedom” — are getting repulsive.', 'Yes, you have the freedom to ball up your fist.', 'No, you don’t have the right to punch me in the face.', 'That’s what anti-vaxxers are doing now. They are punching us in the face by rationalizing their irrational fears. They are throwing up pylons as we crawl back to normal. The situation is not as dire in this country. Canadians should be applauded for taking the virus seriously from the get-go. We recently hit a milestone in which 80 per cent of eligible citizens had received a first dose and 64 per cent are now fully vaccinated. If Canada was hermetically sealed, I wouldn’t be losing sleep. ', 'Today’s column would be about Fred Durst’s new look.', 'But what happens on the other side of the 49th parallel affects us, and what’s happening across the border is scarier than “The Forever Purge.” How this pandemic became political is something future sociologists will have to figure out. But I have read enough stories about the unvaccinated issuing grave regrets on their death beds to realize something very sad has allowed Darwin to put Uncle Sam in a headlock.', 'The other night on CNN, Chris Cuomo interviewed Tony Roman, a California restaurateur who is now demanding his customers prove they are ', 't vaccinated. We are through the looking glass. Roman, who looked and sounded like Dracula on downers, could not explain his inexplicable position. He just seemed to be on a mission to spread far-right gibberish. People, in this job, I know stupid when I hear stupid. And Roman made the cast of “Too Hot to Handle” sound like nuclear physicists.', 'As Cuomo put it near the end: “Honestly, you sound like an idiot.”', 'Indeed. I’m sure Tony Roman can whip up a mean batch of shrimp linguine, but he came across as a total idiot. Meanwhile on Thursday night, over at Fox News, howler monkey Laura Ingraham got into it with lawyer Alan Dershowitz. Ingraham, like fellow howler monkey Tucker Carlson, won’t say if she’s vaccinated. Spoiler alert: they are. But casting doubt on vaccines is good for Fox ratings. ', 'Dershowitz was having none of it. As he told Ingraham: “You may have the right not to get vaccinated, but you have no right to spread the disease to me!”', 'Exactly. What the anti-lockdown, anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers — that Venn diagram is three perfectly overlapping circles — fail to grasp is ', '. I am so sick of hearing about their “rights.” What about the rights of the vaccinated who are forced to live among idiots? Short of herd immunity, what happens if this virus mutates and a variant emerges that is resistant to all current vaccines?', 'Then the world is back to the start of 2020.', 'Sharon Stone and Sean Penn are right to make this a workplace issue. Getting an approved vaccine during a global pandemic is not a matter of personal freedom — it’s about community safety. It’s the same reason you must wear a seatbelt and can’t dump toxic chemicals in the nearest pond. Society has rules. I can’t wander into Home Depot without a shirt, no matter how much the ladies might love it. ', '.', 'If we are to sail away from this virus, we must start rowing in the same direction.']
