Confused about vaccine safety and efficacy? An infectious disease expert answers some common questions | National Post
['With multiple approved vaccines and an incredible amount of discussion across all types of media, it can be hard for people to get answers to their questions and make an informed decision about getting immunized. Having evidence-based answers to common vaccine questions is important, and I hope to answer some of them here.', 'Both Pfizer and Moderna use mRNA as part of their mechanism; mRNA contains instructions on how to make proteins. This happens millions of times a day in your cells, from the moment of conception to death, and is the way we make all the proteins that make us human. It is important to know that this is a one-way stream: our DNA makes RNA, which makes protein. We lack the machinery to go in the other direction.', 'As an analogy, imagine you want to make a cake. You go online, find a recipe, print it out, then take it to the kitchen and bake the cake. It’s a one-way stream: the cake can’t change your printout, and your printout can’t change the online recipe, as they lack the machinery to do so. In the same way, an mRNA vaccine can’t alter someone’s DNA.', 'The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, on the other hand, use viral vectors, which are dead viral shells filled with instructions to create viral spike proteins. The end result is very similar to mRNA vaccines, and neither can integrate into the host.', 'A normal clinical trial for vaccines involves different studies for dose and safety (Phase 1), and effectiveness (Phase 2 and Phase 3). Once these are done, the data is assembled and submitted to a medical regulator for assessment. The last vaccine that was approved was for shingles. Because the disease takes many years to develop in some individuals, the study took years to determine if the vaccine was effective. This is not the case with COVID-19. Since people have been contracting it on a daily basis, it did not take long to determine the efficacy of the vaccines.', 'Rather than assembling all the data together and submitting it to Health Canada, as has happened in the past, there was an agreement that the data would be reviewed as the clinical trials progressed. The reason for this was that, in a global health emergency, there was a need to make sure the administrative delay for approving these drugs was minimized, so lives could be saved if they were found to be effective. However, the review process was entirely the same as for other vaccines and medications.', 'There is a robust global reporting system for people who develop side effects to the vaccines, and this has recently been used to assess the risk of clotting from the AstraZeneca vaccine.', 'It is important to note that the molecules involved in triggering the immune system are short lived: a single protein is produced, and breaks down very quickly. (In comparison, when the body is actually infected by the virus, it produces dozens of proteins.) So, worrying about long-term risks is not an issue, but monitoring for short-term side effects is important.', 'The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines do come with a risk of developing blood clots, so it’s important that people watch for symptoms, such as headaches, visual changes, abdominal pain, leg swelling, chest pain, easy bruising or bleeding for 28 days after receiving the vaccination.', 'Most vaccines will cause a sore arm. Some people will get a fever and feel unwell. This is due to the immune system being activated. Very few individuals will get allergic reactions, and these are dealt with in the vaccination clinic, where staff is trained to deal with these reactions, with no long-term issues.', 'Finally, it’s important to note that 1.4 billion people have so far received a COVID-19 vaccination, and many of those include the vaccines we use in Canada today. While there are reports of people dying after getting the vaccine, the context is important. With tens of millions of people being vaccinated every day, there will be people who die of natural causes after getting the vaccine. However, it is important to note these deaths are not due to vaccine as they would have occurred anyways given the large numbers.', 'If the Canadian supply of vaccines was plentiful, then making sure everyone was vaccinated as per the manufacturer recommendations would be reasonable. However, this is not the case, and with a limited supply of vaccines, using a delayed second dose strategy allows for more protection for a larger population, as compared to optimal protection for a smaller population.', 'One dose of vaccine has significant effects, though. Across many studies, the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 cases has been shown to be reduced by 60-90 per cent after one shot, and the risk of hospitalization and death amongst those who do get infected is markedly reduced.', 'In Ontario, only 0.06 per cent of the 3.5 million people who have received a vaccine have developed COVID-19 within 14 days of receiving their shot, and only a small percentage of those people were hospitalized or died of COVID-19. There is also emerging evidence suggesting that antibody levels may be higher in people who delay the second dose, and that the protection offered by the first dose may increase over time.', 'National Post']
