With the rise of Delta, are vaccines still enough to end the pandemic? | Vancouver Sun
['As health officials warn it could be spring 2022 — after six to eight more months of rolling waves — before COVID is tamed, and only then if 90 per cent of the population is vaccinated, animosity towards the wilfully unvaccinated is growing.', 'A new poll finds that a majority of Canadians believe that the unvaccinated are selfish, irresponsible and putting others at risk, a view the unvaccinated take strong issue with.', 'But do strong-arm tactics like vaccine mandates and passports work, or just entrench resistance and feed conspiratorial thinking? Some have argued that dividing people into the “risky” and “safe” underplays that vaccination may not fully stop transmission of the Delta variant.', 'Vaccines protect against serious disease, Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina tweeted this week. “Vaccines may slow spread — yes,” he said. “But many policies across (the) US & elsewhere assume vaccines totally prevent spread. This leads to outbreaks among vax’d — which ultimately erodes trust in the whole vaccine effort unless the expectations are set properly.”', 'A ', ' estimates that, by late summer, 60 to 80 per cent of the Canadian population will have some immunity to COVID, but that’s still insufficient to stave off a fall resurgence. How severe a rebound depends on the rate of waning immunity, the transmissibility of the hyper-contagious Delta, relaxing of distancing and other public health measures, and how well the vaccines hold up against infection and severe disease, they said. “To prevent large-scale resurgence, booster vaccination and/or re-introduction of public health mitigation may be needed,” the authors wrote.', 'A year and a half into COVID and there’s still so much unpredictability. Still, “uncertainty is part of COVID,” Toronto ', 'To recap this past week alone: ', ' given a rise in confirmed COVID cases and schools reopening, and that it would be left to employers to decide whether to require employees present vaccination passports for those wishing for a physical return to the office. ', ' No, testing won’t be an alternative, the company said in a release, and, except for those with a valid exemption, failure to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 30 will carry consequences “up to and including unpaid leave or termination.”', 'After rejecting a vaccine certificate system, ', ' just that, ', ' (though a province-wide vaccine passport like Quebec’s remains a no-fly zone) and Ontario medical officers of health, weary of Ontario’s dithering, agreed to create their own vaccine certificates as the number of businesses and organizations requiring proof of vaccination swells.', 'Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has vowed to make COVID shots mandatory for boarding planes or trains.', 'There’s a high level of tension and polarization between the vaccinated, a growing majority, and the unvaccinated, said Jack Jedwab, president of the Association for Canadian Studies. “It’s very difficult to have a conversation, because people have become very entrenched in that position — at this juncture, if they’ve not gotten vaccinated, they’re very entrenched in their position.”', 'Polling by Leger for the association suggests a majority of the vaccinated don’t think there’s a rights or civil liberties issue. “They’re not giving that argument any credibility whatsoever,” Jedwab said. “In a public health emergency, your purported rights are violating my desire to protect my health, which is superseding what you describe as rights.” The sticking point may be if a mandate threatens a person’s livelihood, and Jedwab expects the discord and tension will only grow as more people get vaccinated and as the unvaccinated feel more “squeezed.”', 'But it gets messy and murky. While there’s a core contingent of anti-vaccine groups trying to sow disinformation and distrust, “we can’t think of all of these people (the vaccine hesitant or reluctant) as being people who just read something on the Internet and they have decided the virus isn’t real,” said University of Manitoba virologist Jason Kindrachuk. “In a lot of cases there may be a vast, historical context behind all these feelings and reasoning.” Some of the frustration among the pro-vaccine, he said, is the realization that perhaps there was a more appreciable percentage of the reluctant than people realized.', 'Some concerns may not be totally irrational. Some women have reported unusual menstrual cycles, however studies so far have found no evidence COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility and the ability to have children. ', ' found that while the Pfizer vaccine increases the risk of heart inflammation (about three events per 100,000 people vaccinated) the risk is several-fold higher among people infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus (11 cases per 100,000). Infection with COVID was also associated with a substantially increased risk of other seriously bad things, like heart attack, blood clots and bleeding inside the skull or brain.', 'While a ', " published this week suggests immunity, including protection against a breakthrough infection with Delta, lasts longer after a natural infection than immunity after two doses of Pfizer, no one is suggesting COVID parties. “What we don’t want people to say is: ‘All right, I should go out and get infected, I should have an infection party,'” Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University ", ' “Because somebody could die.”', '“When we look at the risks that come with being infected, all the data say getting vaccinated is your safest way to combatting the virus,” Kindrachuk said. “I think it’s tough to argue right now at all against vaccination.”', 'Dithering with COVID “would be a fool’s game,” Morris agreed this week. The virus has moved through the global population, it has continued to change with variants of concern and with increased transmission.', 'At the same time, a study published this week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found that the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) in preventing infections in frontline workers decreased from 91 per cent to 66 per cent after Delta became the dominant strain. The trend should be interpreted with caution, the CDC said — protection might also be declining “as time since vaccination increases.” And the vaccines remain very effective against bad outcomes, like hospitalization and death.', 'But reports of dwindling immunity and breakthrough cases are now driving debate over the need for boosters. In Israel, of 680 people hospitalized with COVID on Thursday, 331 were fully vaccinated. As Reuters reports, most severe breakthrough cases involve people over 60 who also have heart disease, lung problems or other underlying health issues. And despite alarming posts on social media about breakthrough cases in highly vaccinated populations, some context is missing: As an increasing percentage of the population is vaccinated, it follows that the proportion of vaccinated among the infected will also increase, because the shots don’t promise 100 per cent protection. Still, though severe cases are rare, Mina believes breakthrough infections aren’t as rare as they are being made out to be. “The continued message that breakthroughs are rare ultimately shoots us in the foot. They aren’t rare & public is seeing this,” he tweeted.', 'It’s important to monitor for waning immunity, Kindrachuk said. “We don’t have that one specific marker that says, ‘OK, you have X amount of this antibody so that gives you Y amount of years or months of protection.’”', 'And while the vaccinated can still spread the virus, they appear to be less infectious and clear COVID faster than the unvaxxed. Their infections also tend to be milder. “The only people that are really at risk are the unvaccinated,” said Eric Arts, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Western University.', '“And, in certain provinces, we’re taking very serious steps to protect the unvaccinated by preventing their exposure to the virus and the vaccinated population,” he said. “It’s sad that we have to go to the extent to do that, to protect the unvaccinated. But that is what is necessary in this situation, until we get them vaccinated.” B.C., like Quebec before it, saw a jump in vaccination bookings after announcing its passport program.']
